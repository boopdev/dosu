A simple discord bot that shares basic osu! player statistics

dOSU was originally built to share my stats with my peers in a more uniform style. I decided to use discord as a place to send the data, so my peers could also try it out if they wished, I thought it was helpful and I hope that this can help discord bot developers to create their own osu! commands.

You can go to http://osu.ppy.sh/p/api to get an osu api key if you don't already have one.
This is built around the OsuApi python module

To install it open command prompt, make sure python is in your PATH and type:
```
pip install OsuApi
```
You'll have a fully functioning bot up in minutes!
